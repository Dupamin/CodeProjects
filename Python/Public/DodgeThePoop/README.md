Funny name, right? Of course not.<br>
It was called something else before, but due to a possible/very probable/definite lawsuit with a certain company and life in jail, I couldn't keep the name.<br>

You can try to play the game by downloading all the files/cloning the repo and just executing the excecutable. Windows Defender is probably gonna defend you from it, but I swear it's not a virus, you can ignore the warning. Or if you really wanna be safe, just make a virtual machine and execute it there. I would recommend it with any unknown exe file.<br>

It's a really funny game, believe me!

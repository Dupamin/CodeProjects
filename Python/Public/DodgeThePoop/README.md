Funny name, right? Of course not.<br />
It was called something else before, but due to a possible/very probable/definite lawsuit with a certain company and life in jail, I couldn't keep the name.

You can try to play the game by downloading all the files/cloning the repo and just executing the excecutable. It's a really funny game, believe me! (Of course not.)
